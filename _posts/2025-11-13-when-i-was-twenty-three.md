*The following is an excerpt from a work in progress that I haven't figured out how to finish without getting committed.*


When I was twenty-three, there was a pandemic. There was a primary. There was an election. There was a German luxury sedan in my driveway. There was a white turtleneck I'd just bought. There was my mom. There was a fried chicken place walking distance from my home. There was a little yellow house. There was a bunk bed. There was a daily walk up the south end of campus. There was a transom window missing its glazing above the bathroom door. There was cheap rent. There was one set of kitchenware shared. There were mornings. There were evenings. There were occasional 2 AMs.

When I was twenty-three, I was in love.

Growing up in the Restored Gospel as taught by restored priesthood authority within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, being queer didn't exist. It wasn't even something one *could* be. It was merely a temptation, like wanting to steal or to murder. But being told over and over by those with the restored priesthood authority to do so that I *am* heterosexual made it easy to believe—really, to **know**—that the way I felt about women is the way man does. There was no reason to question it, the Spirit testified of it all.

And so when I was twenty-three, I was in love. And when I was twenty-three, I could not know it. When I was twenty-three, I'd stop eating until I felt like I was okay. When I twenty-three, I'd walk and I'd walk and I'd walk and I'd walk. When I was twenty-three, I'd drink half a bottle of Nyquil and drive my BMW up the canyon at 90 MPH. When I was twenty-three, I got two more jobs to cope with the stress. When I was twenty-three, I'd press my face into a pillow until my lungs burned. When I was twenty-three, he sent me the words, "Man kann dir nicht erwidern, was du willst."[^1] When I was twenty-three, I realized that he knew. He'd **known**.

I hadn't.
