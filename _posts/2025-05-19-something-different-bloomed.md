My vision returned all at once, the quiet Stockholm street coming back into focus as quickly as I imagine God created light. 


_Sky; apartment building; Volkswagen Golf VII; street markings; trees._ Where was I? Right, a few yards further down the road than I remembered. No immediate threats visible. _Hem of my shirtsleeve around my bicep; my right shoe lace brushing against my ankle; the breeze; the cushioned sole of my shoe._ I was upright, moving. _Kaden's voice; Maddie's voice; Nick's voice._ Walking was requiring tremendous concentration, as if my mind had shunted all higher processing to basics like balance and breathing. _Lack of cigarette smoke; my deoderant._ Right, breathing. Shuddering, I drew in air, imagining my bronchioles like sailors leaping from their bunks to their battle stations in what were understood to be secure waters. _The flesh of my soft palate._ I felt something like a psychological backup generator kick on, and the rest of my persona was back.

"wEÄrE _puLLIng_ mY Mo**M** froM ^lIfe^ sUpPrOt." "**We'RE** pulling _MY MOM_ from l1fe ßüppport." "We're p+lling **{busy signal}** from life support." "We're [Link](pulling my mom) from **life** support." "We're pulling my mom from life support."

The nerves to my vocal tract found themselves congested with repeated commands, my brain desperately firing until it could properly encode the outcome of the call I had just concluded. The call I still can't remember. My brain had never performed this function before. It had never signaled for help, not for anything _important_. Brutal determination had gotten me through two degrees. White-knuckled faith had kept me in the closet. There'd always been another level to pull, another face to adopt as my own, another way to move forward. If I was good enough, I would win my father's love. If I worked and studied enough, I'd give me resources to protect myself. If I prayed enough, I would be straight. Before that street in Stockholm, I couldn't recall a moment where I felt totally and completely subject to helplessness.

Maddie, Kaden, and Nick gave me a hug. I don't think I remember what else happened in that moment. I'm not sure we even stopped walking. I do remember being grateful I was with them.

On this first anniversary of my mother's passing, I find myself reflecting on the events of her death and the divergent paths my life could have taken. At the time, I found myself almost split into two people. Part of me executing the plan I'd long since made for the possibility we lost her. Another part of me wailing and thrashing against the walls of my mind until my knuckles bled, my eardrums burst, and I could only tell I was screaming from the vibrations in my throat.

These multiple selves living under one canopy of curls is, you may have noticed, a recurring theme on this blog. In reflecting on these selves, the ones that carried me to my mother's death and the ones that carried me through it, I found a face looking back at me: my mother's. 

Part of her legacy is crafting me into someone who can survive this, someone who can become what is necessary to live well. A toddler abandoned by her father. A toddler afraid of his father. The child trying to protect her sister from abuse. A child escaping into his books. The adolescent sent to live away from her family. A teen trying to ensure he'd be able to provide for himself once he turned 18. The University of New Mexico student sitting on top of her parking garage, contemplating the jump. A Marriott School student driving up Provo Canyon on a winter night pushing the limits of too fast. The white returned missionary going back to Oakland to hand deliver her racist mission president an announcement of her wedding to a Tongan man. A gay man slowly coming out in an environment where no amount of celibacy would protect him. The empty nester who, after years of supporting (and at times rescuing) her husband's career found real joy in dedicating her skillset to restarting her own career. A grad student dropping out and moving across an ocean to be closer to his family after tragedy. Throughout her life, she became the person who would save her. By imparting those tools for navigating the world to her children, she became the person who would save me.

On this first anniversary of my mother's passing, I find myself abashed to acknowledge that my strength in any way parallels or measures up to hers—my therapist thinks this is silly. People have told me my mother lives on through me—which I think is silly. She is dead. But I do believe that I can live to honor her. I like to imagine that if I could talk to her, she'd be 27—her age at my birth, my age now. We'd talk about our lives as peers, rather than parent to child. We'd make each other confront our strengths and good qualities. And when it came time to leave, we'd quote to each other the Taylor Swift album she'll have to wait 25 years to hear again:

>_You've got no reason to be afraid_

>_You're on your own, kid_
>
>_Yeah, you can face this_

>_You're on your own, kid_

>_You always have been._
